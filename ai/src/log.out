The provided paragraphs present financial data for Apple Inc. for the three months ending December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021. The data includes calculations for basic and diluted earnings per share, net income, and net sales disaggregated by significant products and services. 

For the three months ending December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, the net income was $29,998 million and $34,630 million respectively. The basic earnings per share for these periods were $1.89 and $2.11, while the diluted earnings per share were $1.88 and $2.10.

The net sales for the three months ending December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, were $117,154 million and $123,945 million respectively. The sales were disaggregated into iPhone, Mac, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, and Services. The company's proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment for the three months ending December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

The provided paragraphs discuss the terms and conditions related to the termination of service, restrictions on transfer, recoupment, and the company's rights in case of a violation by a participant. 

In the event of termination of service, a participant's Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and related Dividend Equivalent Rights will be terminated if they have not vested prior to the termination. This applies regardless of the reason for termination, whether it was voluntary or involuntary, and whether the participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period. 

The paragraphs also outline restrictions on the transfer of the Award, Dividend Equivalent Rights, and any interest therein. These cannot be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise disposed of, either voluntarily or involvably. The company also reserves the right to recoup the Award and any shares or other amounts issued, delivered, or paid in respect of the Award.

Finally, the company has the right to issue instructions on behalf of the participant to any brokerage firm or third-party administrator engaged by the company to hold the participant's shares and other amounts acquired under the plan to return such shares and/or other amounts to the company. This is not the company's exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.

The agreement also specifies that no adjustment will be made for any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited.

The agreement also outlines the procedure for giving notice under the terms of the agreement.

The agreement also states that the award and all rights of the participant are subject to the terms and conditions of the provisions of the plan, and the participant agrees to be bound by these terms.

The agreement also addresses data privacy, with the participant acknowledging and consenting to the collection, use, processing, and transfer of personal data for the purpose of managing and administering the plan. The company and its related entities may transfer data amongst themselves and to third parties assisting in the implementation, administration, and management of the participant's participation in the plan. The participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares subject to the vested RSUs for tax purposes, even if some shares are held back for the purpose of paying tax-related items. The company may refuse to issue or deliver any shares or the proceeds of the sale of shares if the participant fails to comply with their obligations in connection with tax-related items.

The gross margin percentage for products and services fluctuated between 2022 and 2023. The gross margin for products decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. This was primarily due to lower product volume and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, although it was partially offset by a different product mix. However, the product gross margin percentage increased during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022, due to a different product mix, but was again partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies.

The services gross margin increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. This was primarily due to higher services net sales, but was partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher services costs. The services gross margin percentage decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022, due to the weakness in foreign currencies and higher services costs, but was partially offset by improved leverage.

The company's future gross margins could be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the company believes that gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. The total gross margin for the three months ended April 1, 2023, was $41,976 million, and for the six months ended April 1, 2023, it was $92,308 million. The operating expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023, and March 26, 2022, were not specified.

The company's future gross margins are expected to be volatile and face downward pressure due to various factors. The gross margin for products and services for the three and six months ended April 1, 2023, and March 26, 2022, was reported. The total gross margin for the six months ended April 1, 2023, was $92,308 million, a decrease from $96,802 million for the same period in 2022. Operating expenses for the same periods were also provided, with an increase in research and development expenses primarily due to increased headcount-related expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses remained relatively flat.

The provision for income taxes, effective tax rate, and statutory federal income tax rate for the three and six months ended April 1, 2023, and March 26, 2022, were also reported. The company's effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was also lower than the statutory rate due to similar reasons and tax benefits from share-based compensation.

The company believes its cash balances, cash equivalents, unrestricted marketable securities, cash generated by ongoing operations, and continued access to debt markets will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The company's contractual cash requirements have not changed significantly since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations. As of April 1, 2023, the company had $2.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. The company also uses several outsourcing partners for manufacturing and assembly of its products.

The document provides a detailed breakdown of the company's derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022. The derivative assets, which include foreign exchange contracts, are valued at $7,136 million. These assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative liabilities, which include foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts, are valued at $6,119 million. These liabilities are also measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The company has implemented measures to mitigate credit risk associated with its derivative assets. These measures include entering into collateral security arrangements and master netting arrangements with counterparties to the company's derivative contracts. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off, including the effects of collateral, would result in a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.

The company also uses derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments. The notional amounts of the company's outstanding derivative instruments as of July 1, 2023, and September 24, 2022, were also provided.

In the third quarter of 2023, Apple Inc. repurchased $18.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion. The company's operations and financial condition have been and could continue to be significantly affected by macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations. The report also provides a breakdown of net sales by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023, and June 25, 2022.

The net sales by reportable segment showed a decrease in the Americas and Japan, while Europe and Greater China saw an increase. The decrease in the Americas was primarily due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. In Europe, the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone, despite the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Greater China's net sales increase was also due to higher net sales of iPhone, despite the weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar. Japan's net sales decrease was primarily due to lower net sales of iPhone, Services, and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

The Rest of Asia Pacific saw a decrease in net sales during the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower net sales of iPhone and iPad. However, during the first nine months of 2023, the Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased, primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac. The report also provides a breakdown of net sales by category for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023, and June 25, 2022.

The company's effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was lower than the same period in 2022 due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. However, this was partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. The company's operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023, and June 25, 2022, were also reported.

The company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, unrestricted marketable securities, cash generated by ongoing operations, and continued access to debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
