# LINE-AI-Demo

The Line AI demo is a project that leverages Large Language Models on consumer hardware. Its main goal is to exhibit the quality of these models, providing a practical tool for users to experience AI capabilities in real-time.

Furthermore, this demo is the starting point for the LINE VN AI Study Group. This group aims to build a final demonstration product, using this project as a learning and development opportunity, allowing them to explore the complexities of AI.
